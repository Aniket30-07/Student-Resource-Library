# 📚 Student Resource Library  
### Web Dev II – DOM, JavaScript & Frontend Engineering (Batch 2029)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Resource Library** is a fully functional, frontend-only web application that helps students **upload, organize, search, filter, open, and delete academic resources** such as **PDFs, images, and article links**.

The application is built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, with a strong focus on **DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and client-side state management using LocalStorage**.  
All interactions happen dynamically in the browser, without the use of any frontend frameworks or backend servers.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
Students often store academic materials across multiple platforms such as folders, messaging apps, and cloud drives, making it difficult to organize and retrieve resources efficiently.

This project solves the problem by providing:
- A centralized digital library
- Semester-wise categorization (Semester 1 to Semester 8)
- Easy search and filtering mechanisms
- Persistent storage using browser LocalStorage

---

## ✅ Features Implemented
- Add new academic resources dynamically
- Upload **PDF** and **Image** files
- Add **Article links** via URL
- Select semester from **Sem 1 to Sem 8** using dropdown
- Search resources by **title or subject**
- Filter resources by:
  - Resource type (PDF / Image / Article)
  - Semester
- Open resources in a new browser tab
- Delete resources from the library
- Persistent data storage using **LocalStorage**
- Responsive and user-friendly UI
- Input validation and graceful error handling

---

## 🧱 DOM Concepts Used
The project demonstrates extensive usage of core DOM and JavaScript concepts:

- Dynamic creation and removal of DOM elements
- DOM traversal and manipulation
- Event handling (`click`, `input`, `change`)
- Event delegation for efficient handling of dynamic elements
- Conditional rendering based on application state
- Class and style manipulation using JavaScript
- Form handling and validation
- Synchronization between application state and LocalStorage

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Browser APIs (LocalStorage, File API)


## ▶️ Steps to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the project repository
2. Ensure the following files are present:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
4. No additional setup or server is required

---

## 🎨 UI / UX Highlights
- Clean and modern user interface
- Eye-catching color palette and gradients
- Responsive card-based layout
- Smooth hover effects and transitions
- Clear user flow and action feedback


## 🎓 Conclusion
The **Student Resource Library** is a real-world, scalable, and academically aligned frontend project that demonstrates strong proficiency in **DOM manipulation, JavaScript logic, and client-side application development**, making it suitable for final submission and viva evaluation.
